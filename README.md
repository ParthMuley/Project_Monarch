# Project Monarch  

An autonomous, multi-guild AI agent organization inspired by the anime *Solo Leveling*.

This project creates a system where a central "Monarch" agent manages an army of specialized AI agents (organized into guilds) to complete complex, multi-domain tasks. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and capable of learning from its experience.

## ‚ú® Core Features
- **Multi-Guild Architecture:** Agents are organized into specialized guilds (Writers, Coders, Artists).
- **Dynamic Workflows:** The Monarch uses a configuration-driven workflow engine to manage multi-step projects.
- **Agent Career Paths:** Agents gain XP, rank up, and can be promoted to more advanced roles.
- **Tool Use:** High-rank agents can use external tools like a web search and a code interpreter.
- **Persistent Memory:** The organization learns from successfully completed jobs using a vector database.
- **Economic Strategy:** The Monarch makes cost-based decisions to efficiently manage a budget.
- **Professional CLI:** The project is packaged as a clean command-line tool.
